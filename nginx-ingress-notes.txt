I'm currently using a quick and dirty nginx-ingress deployment with one replica.  The problem with this is that it's only available on one node.  Increasing the number of replicas doesn't mean node1 will get a copy because of the dedicated=master:NoSchedule taint.

The ideal option is to deploy nginx-ingress as a DaemonSet, but I need to set hostNetwork: true due to the CNI networking used with kubeadm.
